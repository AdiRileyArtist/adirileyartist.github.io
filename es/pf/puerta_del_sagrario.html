	<blockquote>"The doorway through which you access the Sagrario Church is the oldest work of the cathedral complex and the only example of Gothic architecture in Malaga. It is believed that was opened in 1498 at the base of the minaret of the old mosque, under the mandate of the first bishop of Malaga. This particular piece of my work has been extremely popular with Spanish and tourists alike. The technique that I used to create the shadowing and texture is some what unconventional, taking a graphic ink pen that is almost out of ink and sanding the tip down with fine sand paper to create a brush-like affect."</blockquote>
