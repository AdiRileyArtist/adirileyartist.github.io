	<blockquote><p>"A Brief History of Malaga"</p><p>"An illustration for an idea I had with a friend to make a small book with the history of Malaga, about all of the different people that have called Malaga home throughout the ages, with my illustrations of course. This one includes the cathedral, Malaga eye, alcazaba (Fort), the bull ring, Plaza de la Merced, the beach and parks as well as the old town and more modern buildings."</p></blockquote>
