<!--img src="/images/fulls/03.jpg" class="fit image"--> I am an English artist based in the southern Spanish city of Malaga, I work predominantly as an illustrator creating very stylised black and white, highly detailed artwork, often with a humorous theme. The goal with my art is for people to be captured by their first glance then absorbed into the smaller details and funny twists hidden inside. I’m working on various projects including my own children’s books along with creating one of a kind original illustrations as well as custom artwork that I can tailor to clients’ interests.
