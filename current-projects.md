<!-- PROJECT START -->
<h1 style="font-family: Pacifico;">Project: Fantasy Detective Puzzle Book</h1>

<center><img src="/images/OUaCLogo.jpg" class="image" width="500px"></center>

The story revolves around a city guard who is not the most observant, his job is to help the citizens of the city and solve crimes. Each double page will have a story page with text and an illustration incorporated within it. On the opposite side a highly-detailed illustration in which clues and puzzles will be hidden, your job will be to help the city guard find the hidden items and solve the puzzles to enable him to continue to the next page and eventually solve the crime.

<h2 style="font-family: Pacifico;">Character Design Ideas</h2>

<p>These two zombies are undertakers, I like the idea that the undead are burying the dead. I named Wolfgang after Mozart because his teeth are like piano keys, but the real dangerous one here is Baron Warburton Wyrm who is the underworld criminal boss that lives up Brains's nose.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"He might be called Brains, but I'm the brains of this outfit!"</p>

<p>Mr Stoker named after Bram Stoker is the cities finest butcher and owner of Stoker's Steaks, in the final illustration I'll include his shop's sign, a heart with a wooden stake.</p>

<center><img src="/images/CharacterDesigns/SirJohnCoyote.jpg" class="image" width="500px"></center>

<p>Sir John Coyote, name after Don Quixote is a member of the Knights of the Pale Rider.</p>

<center><img src="/images/CharacterDesigns/PrivateWadsworthMurphy.jpg" class="image" width="500px"></center>

<p>Private Wadsworth is the story's protagonist along with his faithful sidekick Murphy, each page will be seen through his eyes. Each time you encounter someone in the story their portrait will appear on the page to give you a feel for who you are talking to.</p>

<center><img src="/images/CharacterDesigns/RockandTroll.jpg" class="image" width="500px"></center>

<p>Rock and Troll are a band that plays in one of the taverns in the city.</p>

<center><img src="/images/CharacterDesigns/RottonFishRalphl.jpg" class="image" width="500px"></center>

<p>Idea for the fishperson pirate captain, was thinking of possibly doing a parrot fish instead of a bird.</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>"I hate these damn landlubbers!"</p>
</blockquote>

<center><img src="/images/CharacterDesigns/FirstMateBubblehead.jpg" class="image" width="500px"></center>

<p>I Might change the fish inside Bubblehead's goldfish bowl to a puffer fish, so each time the fish get scared they inflate themselves and push his face against the side of the bowl, sticking him with dozens of spikes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"GGGGuuuGGgggUUULLL!?!?!"</p>
</blockquote>

<center><img src="/images/CharacterDesigns/ProfessorCrumples.jpg" class="image" width="500px"></center>

</blockquote>
