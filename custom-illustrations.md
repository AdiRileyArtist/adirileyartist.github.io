		<p>“History Planets” was a custom Illustration for a fan of the past, each planet has a different era of time, a Prehistoric planet with various dinosaurs and Jurassic plants, a Roman planet with a gladiator stood in an arena at the centre, a medieval planet with knights jousting, a WWII planet with tanks, planes, and explosions as well as the “Moon” with a joke about the landing conspiracies, making the moon look like a movie set too.</p>

		<p>“Clank, Clatter, Clang” was a custom illustration for a client’s husband, for his 60th birthday present, he is a keen accordionist in a band and she wanted this incorporated into my normal detailed fantasy style along with a crazy machine like my “Vend-O-Tron Deluxe” illustration. I created a one-man band style contraption that played various musical instruments and then funnelled the music to every corner of the city with a network of twisting pipes. A crowd of fans cheer in the foreground, the only one that seems upset about the proceedings is the cat looking from a nearby window!</p>

		<p>“Overground, Underground” was a custom illustration for a client that wanted 1/3 of the illustration to be underground and the background a landscape of English woodland. I created a castle sat on a hill overlooking a forest of trees below, various animals watch while he digs a hole looking for possible treasures. He is unaware that his Jack Russell is faithfully helping by filling the hole back in for him. Hidden deep underground are various things, like a T-Rex skeleton, an unexploded bomb, and even a flying saucer.</p>
