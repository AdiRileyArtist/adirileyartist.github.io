	<p>With many of my characters I like to use names that many seem pretty random at first, but generally they have a meaning,
		if not instantly obvious. Wolfgang for example is named after Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart the composer, due to his bottom teeth
		protruding like piano keys.

		Sometimes I gave my characters names that will make more sense with the actual story text, for example the worm crawling
		from Brains's nose is Warburton Wyrm who is the "underworld" crime boss of the city. Brains name may seem more obvious, but
		in fact he is the stupid one of the trio, but allows me to say...</p>
