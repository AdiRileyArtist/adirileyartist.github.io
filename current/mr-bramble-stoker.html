	<p>Mr Bramble Stoker is of course named after the original author of Dracula, Bram Stoker. My interpretation is a freindly butcher although, I like the idea that a vampire would choose a job that involved meat and blood. His shop will be called "Stoker's Steaks" and I will include a shop sign that shows a wooded "stake" impaling a heart in the final illustration.</p>
